  abstract     = {Virtual surgical planning (VSP) is commonly used in orthognathic surgery. A precise soft-tissue predictability would be a helpful tool, for determining the correct displacement distances of the maxilla and mandible. This study aims to evaluate the soft-tissue predictability of the VSP software IPS CaseDesigner® (KLS Martin Group, Tuttlingen, Germany). Twenty patients were treated with bimaxillary surgery and were included in the study. The soft-tissue simulation, done by the VSP was exported as STL files in the engineering software Geomagic Control XTM (3D systems, RockHill, SC, USA). Four months after surgery, a 3D face scan of every patient was performed and compared to the preoperative simulation. The quality of the soft-tissue simulation was validated with the help of a distance map. This distance map was calculated using the inter-surface distance algorithm between the preoperative simulation of the soft-tissue and the actual scan of the postoperative soft-tissue surface. The prediction of the cranial parts of the face (upper cheek, nose, upper lip) was more precise than the prediction of the lower areas (lower cheek, lower lip, chin). The percentage of correctly predicted soft-tissue for the face in total reached values from 69.4\% to 96.0\%. The VSP system IPS CaseDesigner® (KLS Martin Group; Tuttlingen, Germany) predicts the patient’s post-surgical soft-tissue accurately. Still, this simulation has to be seen as an approximation, especially for the lower part of the face, and continuous improvement of the underlying algorithm is needed for further development.},

The rotated positions of each configuration may be regarded as individual analyses with the centroid configuration representing a consensus, and this relationship with individual scaling analysis is discussed. A computational technique is given, the results of which can be summarized in analysis of variance form. The special casem = 2 corresponds to Classical Procrustes analysis but the choice of criterion that fits each configuration to the common centroid configuration avoids difficulties that arise when one set is fitted to the other, regarded as fixed.},

  abstract     = {We present a novel physics-based approach to facial animation. Contrary to commonly used generative methods, our solution computes facial expressions by minimizing a set of non-linear potential energies that model the physical interaction of passive flesh, active muscles, and rigid bone structures. By integrating collision and contact handling into the simulation, our algorithm avoids inconsistent poses commonly observed in generative methods such as blendshape rigs. A novel muscle activation model leads to a robust optimization that faithfully reproduces complex facial articulations. We show how person-specific simulation models can be built from a few expression scans with a minimal data acquisition process and an almost entirely automated processing pipeline. Our method supports temporal dynamics due to inertia or external forces, incorporates skin sliding to avoid unnatural stretching, and offers full control of the simulation parameters, which enables a variety of advanced animation effects. For example, slimming or fattening the face is achieved by simply scaling the volume of the soft tissue elements. We show a series of application demos, including artistic editing of the animation model, simulation of corrective facial surgery, or dynamic interaction with external forces and objects.},

  abstract     = {Solid shapes in computer graphics are often represented with boundary descriptions, e.g. triangle meshes, but animation, physicallybased simulation, and geometry processing are more realistic and accurate when explicit volume representations are available. Tetrahedral meshes which exactly contain (interpolate) the input boundary description are desirable but difficult to construct for a large class of input meshes. Character meshes and CAD models are often composed of many connected components with numerous selfintersections, non-manifold pieces, and open boundaries, precluding existing meshing algorithms. We propose an automatic algorithm handling all of these issues, resulting in a compact discretization of the input’s inner volume. We only require reasonably consistent orientation of the input triangle mesh. By generalizing the winding number for arbitrary triangle meshes, we define a function that is a perfect segmentation for watertight input and is well-behaved otherwise. This function guides a graphcut segmentation of a constrained Delaunay tessellation (CDT), providing a minimal description that meets the boundary exactly and may be fed as input to existing tools to achieve element quality. We highlight our robustness on a number of examples and show applications of solving PDEs, volumetric texturing and elastic simulation.},

  abstract     = {While deformable object modeling has been studied by computer graphics specialists for more than two decades, on ly a few applications in the field of surgical simulation have been developed which provide both real-time and physically realistic modeling of complex, nonlinear tissue deformations. Particularly in craniofacial surgery, the prediction of soft-tissue changes—which result from alterations in the underlying bone structure—is critical to the surgical outcome. The prediction of these tissue changes and, therefore, the prognosis of the postoperative appearance of the patient, is still based on empirical studies of the relationship between bone and tissue movements: There exists no physical model which takes into account the individual patient anatomy to simulate the resulting tissue changes during craniofacial surgery. in this article we present two different deformable tissue models which are integrated in an interactive surgical simulation testbed. Both techniques allow precise preoperative simulation of the resulting soft tissue changes during craniofacial surgery and visualization of the patient's postoperative appearance. The different deformable models are described in detail and both are applied to the same craniofacial case study. The simulation results are shown and compared with regard to the speed and accuracy of the prediction of the patient's postoperative appearance.},

  abstract     = {Purpose               It is clinically important to accurately predict facial soft‐tissue changes prior to orthognathic surgery. However, the current simulation methods are problematic, especially in anatomic regions of clinical significance, e.g., the nose, lips, and chin. We developed a new 3‐stage finite element method (FEM) approach that incorporates realistic tissue sliding to improve such prediction.                                         Methods               In Stage One, soft‐tissue change was simulated, using FEM with patient‐specific mesh models generated from our previously developed eFace template. Postoperative bone movement was applied on the patient mesh model with standard FEM boundary conditions. In Stage Two, the simulation was improved by implementing sliding effects between gum tissue and teeth using a nodal force constraint scheme. In Stage Three, the result of the tissue sliding effect was further enhanced by reassigning the soft‐tissue‐bone mapping and boundary conditions using nodal spatial constraint. Finally, our methods have been quantitatively and qualitatively validated using 40 retrospectively evaluated patient cases by comparing it to the traditional FEM method and the FEM with sliding effect, using a nodal force constraint method.                                         Results               The results showed that our method was better than the other two methods. Using our method, the quantitative distance errors between predicted and actual patient surfaces for the entire face and any subregions thereof were below 1.5 mm. The overall soft‐tissue change prediction was accurate to within 1.1 ± 0.3 mm, with the accuracy around the upper and lower lip regions of 1.2 ± 0.7 mm and 1.5 ± 0.7 mm, respectively. The results of qualitative evaluation completed by clinical experts showed an improvement of 46\% in acceptance rate compared to the traditional FEM simulation. More than 80\% of the result of our approach was considered acceptable in comparison with 55\% and 50\% following the other two methods.                                         Conclusion               The FEM simulation method with improved sliding effect showed significant accuracy improvement in the whole face and the clinically significant regions (i.e., nose and lips) in comparison with the other published FEM methods, with or without sliding effect using a nodal force constraint. The qualitative validation also proved the clinical feasibility of the developed approach.},

  abstract   = {A major unsolved problem in computer graphics is the construction and animation of realistic human facial models. Traditionally, facial models have been built painstakingly by manual digitization and animated by ad hoc parametrically controlled facial mesh deformations or kinematic approximation of muscle actions. Fortunately, animators are now able to digitize facial geometries through the use of scanning range sensors and animate them through the dynamic simulation of facial tissues and muscles. However, these techniques require considerable user input to construct facial models of individuals suitable for animation. In this paper, we present a methodology for automating this challenging task. Starting with a structured facial mesh, we develop algorithms that automatically construct functional models of the heads of human subjects from laser-scanned range and reflectance data. These algorithms automatically insert contractile muscles at anatomically correct positions within a dynamic skin model and root them in an estimated skull structure with a hinged jaw. They also synthesize functional eyes, eyelids, teeth, and a neck and fit them to the final model. The constructed face may be animated via muscle actuations. In this way, we create the most authentic and functional facial models of individuals available to date and demonstrate their use in facial animation.},

  abstract     = {In the field of maxillofacial surgery, there is a huge demand from surgeons to be able to pre-operatively predict the new facial outlook after surgery. Besides the big interest for the surgeon during the planning, it is also an essential tool to improve the communication between the surgeon and his patient. In this work, we compare the usage of four different computational strategies to predict this new facial outlook. These four strategies are: a linear Finite Element Model (FEM), a non-linear Finite Element Model (NFEM), a Mass Spring Model (MSM) and a novel Mass Tensor Model (MTM). For true validation of these four models we acquired a data set of 10 patients who underwent maxillofacial surgery, including pre-operative and post-operative CT data. For all patient data we compared in a quantitative validation the predicted facial outlook, obtained with one of the four computational models, with post-operative image data. During this quantitative validation distance measurements between corresponding points of the predicted and the actual post-operative facial skin surface, are quantified and visualised in 3D. Our results show that the MTM and linear FEM predictions achieve the highest accuracy. For these models the average median distance measures only 0.60 mm and even the average 90\% percentile stays below 1.5 mm. Furthermore, the MTM turned out to be the fastest model, with an average simulation time of only 10 s. Besides this quantitative validation, a qualitative validation study was carried out by eight maxillofacial surgeons, who scored the visualised predicted facial appearance by means of pre-defined statements. This study confirmed the positive results of the quantitative study, so we can conclude that fast and accurate predictions of the post-operative facial outcome are possible. Therefore, the usage of a maxillofacial soft tissue prediction system is relevant and suitable for daily clinical practice.},

This model is valid for large displacements, which means in particular that it is invariant with respect to rotations. This property improves the realism of the deformations and solves the problems related to the shortcomings of linear elasticity, which is only valid for small displacements. We also address the problem of volume variations by adding to our model incompressibility constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of this approach for the real-time simulation of laparoscopic surgical gestures on the liver.},

  abstract     = {Recent years have seen growing interest in 3D human face modeling due to its wide applications in digital human, character generation and animation. Existing approaches overwhelmingly emphasized on modeling the exterior shapes, textures and skin properties of faces, ignoring the inherent correlation between inner skeletal structures and appearance. In this paper, we present SCULPTOR, 3D face creations with               Skeleton Consistency Using a Learned Parametric facial generaTOR               , aiming to facilitate the easy creation of both anatomically correct and visually convincing face models via a hybrid parametric-physical representation. At the core of SCULPTOR is LUCY, the first large-scale shape-skeleton face dataset in collaboration with plastic surgeons. Named after the fossils of one of the oldest known human ancestors, our LUCY dataset contains high-quality Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the complete human head before and after orthognathic surgeries, which are critical for evaluating surgery results. LUCY consists of 144 scans of 72 subjects (31 male and 41 female), where each subject has two CT scans taken pre- and post-orthognathic operations. Based on our LUCY dataset, we learned a novel skeleton consistent parametric facial generator, SCULPTOR, which can create unique and nuanced facial features that help define a character and at the same time maintain physiological soundness. Our SCULPTOR jointly models the skull, face geometry and face appearance under a unified data-driven framework by separating the depiction of a 3D face into shape blend shape, pose blend shape and facial expression blend shape. SCULPTOR preserves both anatomic correctness and visual realism in facial generation tasks compared with existing methods. Finally, we showcase the robustness and effectiveness of SCULPTOR in various fancy applications unseen before, like archaeological skeletal facial completion, bone-aware character fusion, skull inference from images, face generation with lipo-Level change and facial animations, etc.},

Results The average error of eight soft tissue landmarks measured between 0.37 and 2.01 mm except from a landmark that had an error of 4.44 mm; values close to those obtained with the linear FE method. On the other hand, the scaled displacement method allows avoiding punctual stress concentration and bending effects making a much more realistic simulation in the region of the bone cut. Conclusions Good results have been achieved with our two proposed methods. In addition, the simple way in which MSM can be parallelized makes it an interesting alternative to FE method.},

  abstract     = {Meshes are an indispensable representation in many graphics applications because they provide conformal spatial discretizations. However, mesh-based operations are often slow due to unstructured memory access patterns. We propose MeshTaichi, a novel mesh compiler that provides an intuitive programming model for efficient mesh-based operations. Our programming model hides the complex indexing system from users and allows users to write mesh-based operations using reference-style neighborhood queries. Our compiler achieves its high performance by exploiting data locality. We partition input meshes and prepare the wanted relations by inspecting users' code during compile time. During run time, we further utilize on-chip memory (shared memory on GPU and L1 cache on CPU) to access the wanted attributes of mesh elements efficiently. Our compiler decouples low-level optimization options with computations, so that users can explore different localized data attributes and different memory orderings without changing their computation code. As a result, users can write concise code using our programming model to generate efficient mesh-based computations on both CPU and GPU backends. We test MeshTaichi on a variety of physically-based simulation and geometry processing applications with both triangle and tetrahedron meshes. MeshTaichi achieves a consistent speedup ranging from 1.4× to 6×, compared to state-of-the-art mesh data structures and compilers.},
